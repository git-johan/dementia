# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

We are using ADRs to document our architectural decisions. Each ADR is a document that describes a specific decision made during the development of our software. The ADRs are stored in the `docs/adr` directory and are named using a timestamp and a short description of the decision.

# Important Notes
* When we are deciding on changing the architecture, we should highlight the reasons for the change and the impact it will have on the system.
* If we are introducing new libraries or technologies, we should document the reasons for the choice and why they are important enough to justify the change.
