# Development

This folder will contain services that are being built for production.

## Purpose

- **Production-bound code** that is actively being developed
- **Maintained code quality** with proper testing and documentation
- **Stable services** that could eventually be deployed to production
- **Graduation path** for successful research projects

## Current Status

Currently empty - all current work is in the research phase.

## What Will Live Here

When research projects prove successful and need to be built for production:

- **FastAPI services** with proper architecture
- **Database schemas** for PostgreSQL
- **API documentation** and testing
- **Deployment configurations**
- **Monitoring and logging** setup

## Graduation Criteria

For a research project to graduate to development:

- ✅ **Proven concept** from research phase
- ✅ **Clear requirements** and success metrics
- ✅ **Architecture decisions** documented in ADRs
- ✅ **User validation** or market demand
- ✅ **Quality standards** for production code

## Examples of Future Services

- `trusted-sources-service/` - If the research proves valuable
- `chat-service/` - Norwegian LLM integration (commercial or self-hosted)
- `transcription-service/` - NB-Whisper as a production service
- `user-management-service/` - User accounts and privacy controls

*Reminder: We're not ready for production yet, but this structure helps us think clearly about what production-ready looks like.*
