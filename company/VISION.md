## Why

**Learning to live with dementia**

Helping millions of families find a few more good years together (not find a cure)

---

## How

**Help families understand dementia and feel in control** (overview and personalized information)

**Slow the decline by turning everyday moments into therapy** (just in-time assistance)

**Empower doctors by bridging the gap between home and healthcare** (more information and better questions)

### Core Insight

The more involved a person with dementia stays (in conversations, decisions, and relationships) the slower the illness progresses.

But keeping them involved becomes increasingly difficult and painful for families, and eventually feels hopeless.

## The Problem

### The Support System is Broken

Dementia is a cruel disease. It affects more than 55 million people worldwide, set to double in the next 20 years, and almost every family will encounter it at some point. Yet dementia doesn't only affect those diagnosed — it reshapes the lives of everyone around them.

When a person develops dementia, families are left trying to understand what is happening and how to cope. The loss of understanding creates stress and uncertainty, which over time can turn into **frustration, guilt, and even resentment**. Despite their best intentions, families end up feeling alone and overwhelmed.

The medical system treats it as a diagnosis. But to those closest it's a **daily crisis**.

### The Opportunity

Dementia isn't just a human crisis; it's one of the fastest-growing cost drivers in healthcare.

For the first time, technology makes it possible to offer personalized, evidence-based support at scale. AI can listen, learn, and guide — turning medical knowledge and empathy into real help for families, every day.
