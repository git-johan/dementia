## Core: A Really Empathic AI Assistant That You Can Talk To

### Foundation Layer: Curated, Trusted Sources

At its core it has access to curated, trusted sources of information about dementia. It should feel like it's curated by your doctor, made available through the AI assistant at any time. No matter what question you have, you'll get an answer as long as there are trusted sources for that data.

### Context Layer: Everything Relevant to Care-taking

Users can feed in anything that's relevant to their care-taking:

- Recordings of talks with the doctor
- Conversations with the patient/loved ones
- Conversations between the family
- Photos/scans of important medical documents
- Their treatment plans
- How they plan to keep the patient engaged
- Whatever it is

All of this will become context/memory for the AI assistant.

### Engagement Layer: Staying Connected

Some sort of engagement system that helps them stay on top of what they need to do. Whether this is tasks, gamification, or whatever it is we don't know yet.
